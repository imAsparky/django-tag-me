tag-me Multi Select init

Overview
========

There's a connection between `const options` and the `options` variable within your Alpine.js component, but the
relationship has an important nuance.

**Let's break it down:**

* **`options` (within the Alpine component):** This is a property defined within your `Alpine.data` object. It acts as a container to store and manage the list of options used by your custom select component.

* **`const options` (inside `init`):**  This variable is declared _within the scope_ of the `init` function. It temporarily holds a reference to the elements from the original `<select>` element.

**How They Work Together**

1. **Initialization:**  When the `init` function runs, `const options = document.getElementById(this.elementId).options;`  fetches the option elements from your original HTML `<select>`.
2. **Data Transfer:** The `for` loop iterates through these fetched `options` and builds a new array.  The data (value, text, etc.)  from each option is transformed into a suitable format and pushed into the `this.options` array belonging to your Alpine.js component.

**Key Points:**

* **Scoped Variables:**  `const options` inside `init` is like a local workspace - visible only within the `init` function. The `options` inside your Alpine.js component has broader visibility.
* **Data Flow:**   Think of data flowing from the original `<select>` into your Alpine.js component.

**In summary, they are related in how the data gets initialized.  However, once the `init` function finishes,  `const options` (the local variable) ceases to  exist. From that point on, your custom component primarily manages its state using its own `options` array.**
